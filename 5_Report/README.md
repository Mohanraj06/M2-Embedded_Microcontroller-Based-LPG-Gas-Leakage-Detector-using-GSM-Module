## INTRODUCTION
The presence of dangerous LPG leakage in the cars, service station or in the storage tank environment can be detected using the Ideal Gas Sensor. This LPG gas leakage detector unit can be easily integrated into a unit that can sound an alarm or give a visual suggestion of the LPG concentration. The sensor has both admirable sensitivity and rapid response time. This sensor can also be used to sense other gases like iso-butane, propane, LNG and even cigarette smoke.

The output of the sensor goes LOW as soon as the LPG sensor senses any gas leakage from the storage. This is detected by the microcontroller and the LED & buzzer is turned ON. After the delay of few milliseconds, the exhaust fan is also turned ON for throwing the gas out and it continues sending message as ‘GAS LEAKAGE’ to a mobile number which is pre-defined.
